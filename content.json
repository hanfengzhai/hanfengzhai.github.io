The success of AlphaGo burst the public’s interest by showing the huge potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The ML techniques shows promising results, specifically in medicine, e.g., AlphaFold for discovering protein structures, COVID-19 detections, etc. both are becoming more significant in our aging societies. Deep neural networks (DNNs), as one of the most prominent tools of ML, have been adopted to tackle various physics problems including turbulence, flow control, heat transfer, and combustion. These deep learning applications have grown drastically in recent years, mainly on learning physical equations and inferring dynamics. Numerous novel frameworks has henceforth been proposed: SINDy and PDE-FIND, using sparse regression to identify the governing equations for nonlinear dynamic systems; Graph Kernel Network, Fourier Neural Operator and MeshfreeFlowNet, using convolutional neural networks to learn image mapping the physics fields; Deep potential, DeePMD and DeePCG, using deep neural nets to map the molecular potentials at the microscale. In 2018, Raissi et al. proposed a deep learning framework called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for identifying and inferring dynamics of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The strategy of PINN can be simplified as embed governing PDEs into the loss function as a soft physics constraint, namely the ‘physics-informed’ part. Based on PINN, Lu et al. then proposed DeepXDE and DeepONet, the refined versions of PINNs, for learning and inferring nonlinear operators of PDEs. The PINN series has been developed to solve numerous problems, including Fractional PINNs for predicting fractional PDEs; Conservative PINNs for nonlinear conservation laws; Extended PINNs, a PINN approach for space-time domain decomposition; Parareal PINNs, a PINN solver decomposing a long-time problem into many independent short-time problems supervised by an inexpensive/fast coarse-grained (CG) solver; and many related PINNs. Besides, PINNs has achieved great success for predicting laminar flows and high speed flows, heat transfer and turbulence. Bubbly flows is a classic fluid mechanics problem, specifically at the mesoscale. The bubble pinch-off effect confined in microtube is one of the most studied problems in fluid mechanics (Dollet et al., Herrada et al., van Hoeve et al., Vega et al., Zhao et al.), depicting deformation and movement of single bubble dynamics. Single bubble movement has also been studied for investigating blood-brain barrier (Miao et al., Hosseinkhah et al., Hosseinkhah et al.). Bubbly flow with multiple bubbles displays complexity due to the interactions between bubbles (Talu et al., Tenjimbayashi et al.), which are also widely studied for drug delivery (Papadopoulou et al., Peyman et al.). Acknowledging the importance and numerous applications of bubbly flow, and realizing the powerful tool of physics based machine learning, we here apply machine learning to infer and predict the bubbly flow. Our work is inspired by Raissi et al. and Lin et al. using physics-informed deep learning to infer bubble dynamics. Different from Lin et al.‘s approach, we do not adopt the theoretical model optimized for modeling bubble (i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset equation). Instead, we directly compute how bubble moves through numerical simulations of multiphase flow. Based on PINNs, we also propose a new deep learning architecture, called BubbleNet, which entails three main parts: deep neural networks (DNN) with sub nets for predicting different physics fields; the physics-informed part, with the fluid continuum condition encoded within; the time discretized normalizer (TDN), an algorithm to normalize field data per time step before training. We apply the traditional DNN and our BubbleNet to train the simulation data and predict the physics fields of both the two bubbly flow cases. Methods &amp; ResultsTwo cases were set up for investigating the bubble flow: $^1$ single bubble flow and $^2$ multiple bubbles flow, confined in a microtube. For the single bubble case: the microbubble diameter is set to be $d = 4\\mu \\rm m$; the micro-tube has a length of 15$\\mu$m and diameter of $5\\mu \\rm m$; we set up periodic boundary conditions (BCs) as $\\Delta p = 10 \\rm Pa$, and the tube is confined at the end as constant pressure $p = 799.932 \\rm Pa$ (6mmHg), corresponding to the pressure in human interstitial fluid. the initial conditions (ICs) is set as the pressure $p_0 = 799.932Pa$, with room temperature as $293.15K$. For the multiple bubbles flow: 60 micro-bubbles are randomly distributed in a 2D micro-tube with a length of $100\\mu \\rm m$ and a diameter of $50 \\mu \\rm m$, with each micro-bubble of the diameter of $3\\mu \\rm m$. The BCs and ICs are same with the single bubble case: $ \\Delta p = 10 \\rm Pa$, constant pressure at tube end $p = 799.932 \\rm Pa$ and $p_0 = 799.932 \\rm Pa$, with room temperature as $293.15K$. Both the meshing of the two bubbly flows are set to be extremely fine. For a single bubble case, the simulation is run for $5000 \\mu \\rm s$, and for the multiple bubbles case, the simulation is run for $3000 \\mu \\rm s$. Simulation for the single bubble flow case. Simulation for the multiple bubbles flow case. The basic structure of BubbleNet is shown in the following figure, as introduced previously. Where we differenciate the latent function $\\psi$ to compute the velocities $u$ and $v$: $u = {\\partial \\psi \\over \\partial y},\\ v = - {\\partial \\psi \\over \\partial x}$ We use the mean square error (MSE) for computing the loss function: $L = MSE\\left( u_{pred} - u_{train} + v_{pred} - v_{train} + … + \\phi_{pred} - \\phi_{train}\\right)$ We used traditional deep neural network and our BubbleNet to predict the physics fields $u,\\ v,\\ p,\\ \\phi$, of bubbly flow. Here, we show the level set phase function $\\phi$ prediction for both the bubbly flow of a single bubble and multiple bubbles are shown in the following figures, at $2000 \\mu \\rm s$ for the single bubble case and $1500 \\mu \\rm s$ for the single bubble case. Training for 10000 iterations for the single bubble case and 200000 iterations for the multiple bubbles case. Adopting the Adam optimizer and ‘L-BFGS-B’ optimization method.

Arola$^*$ STATEMENT: This is a joint project between SHU and UW by Profs. Dongsheng Zhang &amp; Dwayne Arola. Siyong Liu is a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Dongsheng Zhang. Hanfeng joined the project in 2019 and involved during most of his junior year, he assists Siyong in preparing the enamel specimen, observing the microstructures through SEM, modeling the enamel microstructure and conduct numerical simulations. The results shown on this site are generated by both Siyong, Hanfeng, and Bingbing. AbstractEnamel possesses ingenious hierarchical structure which gives rise to superior fracture resistance. Despite considerable efforts devoted to characterization of fracture behavior of enamel, the role of rod decussation in fracture of enamel is largely unknown. In this study, the features of rod decussation in the inner enamel are experimentally identified, and analyses of crack growth in enamel are carried out using a micromechanical model of enamel, in which the structural features of the outer enamel and rod decussation of the inner enamel are incorporated. We carry out calculations within a framework based on the extended finite element method, and the crack growth and crack path selection are natural outcomes of imposed loading. We show that crack deflection in enamel is controlled by rod decussation. For crack growth in the parazone, the crack path is oriented along the axis of enamel rods, leading to gross crack deflection. The microstructure of inner enamel with intermediate decussation angle enables multiple crack deflections, giving rise to enhanced toughness. For crack growth in the diazone, the transition in orientation of crack deflection occurs as decussation angle of enamel rods increases. The relatively straight crack path emerges in the case of the microstructure of enamel with intermediate decussation angle, leading to weak fracture resistance. It is further found that compared with the diazone, the gross crack deflection in the parazone provides greater contribution to fracture resistance of enamel. The findings of this study provide a good mechanistic understanding of the role of rod decussation in enamel.

Stage V: Discussion &amp; ConclusionIn this study, we have developed a numerical simulation capability which is capable of delineating the major structural features of rod decussation in the inner enamel and predicting crack paths in microstructure of enamel. Using this numerical simulation capability, we have carried out analyses of growth of a crack initiating in the outer enamel into the inner enamel. It is found that for crack growth in the parazone, rod decussation leads to the deviation of crack path, giving rise to enhanced toughness of enamel. The microstructure of enamel with intermediate decussation angle can activate multiple crack deflections, providing high degree of toughening. For crack propagation in the diazone, the local crack deflection occurs and transition in orientation of crack deflection takes place with increasing decussation angle. The negligible crack deflection is observed in the microstructure of enamel with intermediate decussation angle, which leads to low degree of toughening. It is further revealed that compared with the diazone, gross crack deflection in the parazone enables higher toughness."},{"title":"","date":"2020-03-25T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2021-06-12T02:02:31.898Z","comments":true,"path":"chip.html","permalink":"www.hanfengzhai.net/chip.html","excerpt":"Thermal estimation of the smartphone chipAuthor: Hanfeng Zhai STATEMENT: This is a independent course project carried out by Hanfeng Zhai for Elastic Mechanics.
